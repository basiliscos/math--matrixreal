I suggest reading
[My First Pull Request](https://github.com/CPAN-PRC/resources/wiki/My-first-Pull-Request)
and [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to learn more about pull requests.

* Create a branch, probably from master

  ```git checkout -b descriptive_branch_name```
  
* Fix the bug or add the feature
* Keep whatever style formatting is in the file you are editing (spaces/tabs/indentation/etc)
* Update ChangeLog that describes the change
* Add yourself to CREDITS if you are not there
* Run the tests again and make sure they pass.

  ```prove -lrv t/```
  
* Make sure everything you think is committed is actually committed.
* Push your changes to your fork on Github
* Submit a Pull Request (PR)
* As the PR evolves, you can keep pushing to the same branch and the PR will update with the latest commits
